Business name: Hajj Companion – رفيق الحجاج

Business Slogan: “Making Hajj easier with your help” – "تسهيل عملية الحج بمساعدتكم"

What does it do?
Hajj companion helps track what you should be doing as a Hajaj and will guide and ask for your review after every 
part being done to help the responsible sectors to improve their departments.
After obtaining efficient funding, it will be used to translate the site into all languages possible to give a 
great feedback. It can be summarized as a guiding and reviewing site that would help make the Hajaj life easier,
from the moment they get off the plane till they leave Mecca.
It will currently be presented as a website, and in the future the funding would be used to create iOS & Android apps.
